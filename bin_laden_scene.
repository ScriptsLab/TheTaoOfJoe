FADE IN:

EXT.  HURON AVE NIGHT

Guy on his carriage with the horse Journey says goodbye to customers.  The couple go to the meet Journey and talk to horses like people do.  A taxi on Michigan Ave turns off its light and idle parks at the curb.  The couple leave and Guy and Jouney begins the trip back to the stable.  When the carriage gets to the Green a local hops onto the carriage.

           LOCAL:

How about a trip to the chicken shack.

            GUY:

Down the street?

             LOCAL:

At the half block.

             GUY:
Ok.  Name?

             LOCAL:
Does it matter?


             GUY:
Nope.

The carriage stops at the Chicken Shack.  The local gets off.  A taxi cruises towards the stables.

            LOCAL:
Thanks.

The local waves goodbye.  Guy gives a half salute and half of a wave.  Guy and Journey take the back alley into the stable.  Guy unbridles journey.  Cleans him off for the night.  Hangs up the gear.  Counts the money and turns it into the Boss, says goodnight exits the stable.  Girls from the strip club are hanging around outside with their Johns.  A taxi pulls up from behind Guy who decides to take it.  He gets in.  He automatically gives the driver the address of the apartment.   

            DRIVER:
You are from Chicago?

            GUY:
For now.

            DRIVER:
What do you do next?

            GUY:
Go home.

After settling into the taxi he finally sees the driver.  He is an Arab with a grey beard with dark lines.

            DRIVER:
Where is your home other than Chicago?

The driver clearly looks like Osama Bin Laden.  Guy does not know wether to believe his eyes.

            GUY:
Wisconsin.


            DRIVER:
You go home to Wisconsin and then what?

             GUY:
I'll go back to school.


The image is real but still too difficult to believe.  Maybe this is someones idea of a joke.

             DRIVER:
What do you think about war in Afghanistan?

             GUY:
It is not something I know a lot about.

             DRIVER:
Do you think it is a Christian war against Muslims and Islam?

             GUY:
No.  It is about 9/11.

            DRIVER:
Do you know why Taliban in control of Afghanistan?

            GUY:
I heard they used to work for the CIA.

           DRIVER:
Because the Alliance armies are rapists and the Taliban stopped the raping.  It is my country and I do not want people to be confused.  You are Jewish?  You look like a Jew.

           GUY:
I'm Italian Czech and Austrian German.

           DRIVER:
So you are a Christian Jew?

           GUY:
Not that I know of.

           DRIVER:
The Christian Jews moved to Italy.  What do you think of Muslims and Islam?

           GUY:
I have only read a few parts of the Koran.

           DRIVER:
You read Arabic?

           GUY:
No.  It was in english.

           DRIVER:
Its not the Holy Koran then.  A good place to start though.  What were you taught about Muslims and Islam as a Christian Jew?

           GUY:
We are all the sons of Abraham.   It would be cool if we could get our act togeather as brothers.

           DRIVER:
The Christian Jew Priests tell you this?

           GUY:
No.  The Norwegian pastor.  You can let me out here.

          DRIVER:
It is only three more blocks.  Christian Jews listen to Norwegians in America?

          GUY:
It doesn't matter.  The Pastor invited the Rabbi to bible classes and he says the same thing.  You can let me out here.

The driver pulls the car to the side of the road under under an Elevated station track.

         DRIVER:
The meter machine says twenty three dollars and eighty eight cents.  Just give me a twenty dollar bill.

Guy hands over the twenty and gets out of the car.  He says thanks before closing the door and gives a unsure wave goodbye.  The driver looks at with a tempered intensity and nods his goodbye.
